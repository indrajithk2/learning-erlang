Today starting learning TeX. It is different. 
The macro system is interesting. I am still to
figure out how to control various elements of
a page. Also, positioning is what I am interested.


LaTeX is quite interesting. It has a steep learning curve. 
Understandig the concepts are very time consuming. 
I think, I have to take up an exercise and then ponder
on how to do that, by learning LaTeX / TeX every day. 
It is going to be very tough. 

I think, things are better now. I am able to parse an 
XML using python, and it so easy. Now, the task is to 
create an LaTeX file using jinja2.
