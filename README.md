My Erlang Learning Notes

# About the files
All the files here are literate program files. 
I find writing literate programs as the best way to learn new programming languages.
I use nuweb. In order to compile the .w files found here, you may need a copy of 
nuweb from sourceforge. The command line I use is nuweb -lr <filename.w>. This produces
a LaTeX file, which can then be converted to pdf pdflatex available with a LaTeX 
distribution like MikeTeX or TeXLive.
