\section{Philosophy of Webmachine}

Webmachine presents HTTP protocol as a state machine. 
It differs from other frameworks in that, it exposes 
the complete HTTP, while others get away with routing
requests via methods and URLs and to return a few types
of responses. HTTP is capable of quite a lot, and is 
often hidden from the developer. Webmachine on the 
other hand offers the developer to utilize the entire 
HTTP in a convenient way. There are no frameworks that
has attempted to expose HTTP this way, which makes 
this unique. Few of the HTTP capabilites are 
content negotiation, encodings, and caching. They are
almost non existent in other frameworks.
