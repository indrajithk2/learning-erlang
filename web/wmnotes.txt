Today, I started learning webmachine. It seems the HTTP 
protocol is converted to a state machine. The user, needs
just plug the code where necessary to get it running. 
I started with trying zotonic, and to some extent, I couldn't
understand it. After a while I realized that I need to understand
webmachine to make any progress in zotonic. I plan is to read the 3 day 
plan as described in "Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Days".
