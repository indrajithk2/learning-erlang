About Templates
----------------
Any front face to latex templates through browser
requires the user input to be converted to LaTeX.
This will require changing the inputs to LaTeX, and 
for the same reason will require templates. With out 
templates, there will be a lot of hard coding that 
has to be avoided. Using python for the task seems to
be logical, as it has support for Jinja2. But, again
interacting with Erlang and Python seems bit complex
for the task. Another way is to use a Erlang template
but, the choices are very limited. This needs to 
be further investigated.  


Progress
----------
Till I have a proper knowledge of zotonic, I have 
decided to develop a command line application 
in erlang. 

http://erlang.org/doc/apps/xmerl/xmerl_ug.html
This has a good description of how to use XML. 
I have to read that tomorrow. 

After a quite of investigation, I think ConTeXt and
LuaTex may be a better way to generate tex files 
then hardcoding.
